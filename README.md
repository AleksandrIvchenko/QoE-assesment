# QoE-Assesment
This project is about my PhD research at the field of QoE estimation.
My study focus on:
- Stastistics
- Machine Learning
- Correct Databases
- Neural Networks
- Experiments stands
- Network conditions and Protocols
- Correct MOS/DMOS collecting
- ITU standards


My initial study based on Wateloo SQoE-III database, the most powerfull and correct at the 2019.The original dataset is organized in the form of Matlab code, it was necessary to transform it into a table.

The first part is devoted to preprocessing the raw features, adding features from the article to it. The result is a table of characteristics and a target value MOS.

In the second part, a statistical analysis of features is carried out and the most and the leas important fratures are founded.

The third part is devoted to the construction of models and their analysis.


If you have any questions, I am available at ivchenko.a.v@phystech.edu

I will update this projects with new papers and data.
In a few days I will finish the text of my PhD thesisis and reorganize the code.
