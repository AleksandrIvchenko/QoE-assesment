# QoE-Assesment
This project is about my PhD research at the field of QoE estimation.
My study focus on:
- Stastistics
- Machine Learning
- Correct Databases
- Neural Networks
- Experiments stands
- Network conditions and Protocols
- Correct MOS/DMOS collecting
- ITU standards

If you have any questions, I am available at ivchenko.a.v@phystech.edu

I will update this projects with new papers and data.
